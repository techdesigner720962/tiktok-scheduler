### Explanation:
- **Permissions:** Permissions for internet and external storage are declared to allow the application to interact with TikTok's API and manage content effectively.
- **Main Activity Registration:** The MainActivity is defined as the entry point for users, facilitating interaction with the scheduling features.
- **Service Registration:** The AutomationService enables background operations, ensuring that tasks are automated and run continuously, which is essential for effective content management. 

This configuration addresses real-world challenges in social media management, specifically for scheduling content on TikTok, and leverages MadHub's capabilities for a seamless user experience.
